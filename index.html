                             <h3>Beth Griggs, former ESL teacher and school administrator, now works in multiple fields including as a Yoga Therapist and Ayurvedic Medicine Practitioner. Discovering that love of language translated to computer language, she began building interactive processes in webpages and systems for her own business and others. Discovering computer skills are easy as Sanskrit, she quickly developed deep skills for making the internet more kinesthetically interactive. This integration of kinesthetic interest with language and practical application is where it all emerges uniquely for her clients!</h3>

                             <h3>Beth uses computers to interact physically or aproximate physciality with the world. Inspiration comes through travel in places such as Indonesia and Greece and movement in dance and yoga. Otherwise, when she is not busily memorizing the uses of Indian medicinal herbs and their properties, she can be found exploring unusual landscapes, buildings, and other physical environments in which she mines structural and experiential concepts to apply within her creations and interactions. </h3>
